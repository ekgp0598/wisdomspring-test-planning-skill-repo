# Admin Policy Summary

Use this file when testing WisdomSpring behavior that depends on admin configuration or lifecycle rules.

For admin list columns, detail fields, registration flow, edit or delete locks, and field-level constraints, also read `admin-planning-spec.md`.

## Theme management

- Expose themes on the front by open date.
- Keep `NEW` state until the next theme opens.
- Use open date, not registration date, for admin list search and inspection.
- Allow 1 to 10 thumbnails per theme.
- Expose the thumbnail with the latest valid exposure date as of today.
- Restrict subtheme content type:
  - `TALK`, `BOOK`, `ETC-영상` accept video content only.
  - `ESSAY`, `ETC-아티클` accept article content only.
- Show `COMING SOON` before open.
- Show `NEW` for one week after open.
- Reapply state rules when the open schedule changes later.
- Block theme exposure on when the subtheme has no content.
- Block duplicate content registration across themes or subthemes.

## Today's question

- Block duplicate registration for the same date.
- Block registration for past dates.
- Block edit and delete for already-opened past questions.

## Today's content

- Manage today's quote or sentence together with today's content, not as a separate feature.
- Block duplicate registration for the same date.
- Allow registration for past dates.
- Block edit and delete for already-opened content and quote.

## Answer records

- Keep hidden answers visible in the admin management list.
- Hide deleted answers from the admin management list.

## Content notes

- Treat note deletion as hidden-state processing, not physical deletion.
- Hide deleted notes from the admin note list.

## Testing implication

When a front behavior conflicts with these rules, mark it as a likely bug. When the local screen artifact conflicts with this file, mark it as a spec gap and report both sources.
